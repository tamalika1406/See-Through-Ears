Our goal is to bridge the gap between the visual world and those who are visually impaired by
developing an innovative product called "See through your Ears." By harnessing the power of
deep learning, we aim to convert visuals into real-time audio descriptions, enabling individuals
with visual disabilities to gain a descriptive sense of their surroundings.

**Executive Summary**
The "See through your Ears" project aims to develop a prototype of a product that converts
visuals into real-time audio descriptions for individuals with visual disabilities. With an
estimated 40-50 million WHO blind people worldwide, there is a significant need to
enhance inclusivity and independence for this community. With a descriptive sense of the
surroundings through audio, the product aims to empower individuals with visual disabilities.
In this report, we evaluate the success of the initiative by identifying key metrics that would help
track the value and engagement of this product once it is commercialized. These metrics provide
valuable insights into the reception of the product, its impact on users, market penetration, and
potential expansion strategies. Analytics play a crucial role in the development and success of
this project, enabling data collection, pre-processing, and speech translation.
The product utilizes the COCO (common objects in context) image captioning dataset for
training and evaluating the model. The model architecture includes components for image
captioning, text-to-speech conversion, and data processing. The report will also provide snippets
of the model results to demonstrate the progress made. As this is a prototype, we have included
our forward-looking ideas to improve model accuracy and commercialize the product, enhancing
its usability and portability.
Through product development, partnerships, and effective marketing, the project has a potential
to achieve its objective of enhancing inclusivity and independence for people with visual
disabilities. By leveraging analytical techniques and insights gained from data analysis, this
prototype can further enhance the accuracy and efficiency of the model, ensuring that the
converted visuals are very precisely described in real-time audio, as we plan to scale their usability
for a larger target audience.

**Metrics of Success**
To evaluate the success of the initiative and measure the impact of our product, the business
can consider the following key metrics according to our knowledge:

● User Adoption and Engagement: This metric will provide insights into how well the
product is being received and utilized by the target audience. Key metrics could be:
      - Number of product downloads or installations (to gauge the level of interest and
      the initial adoption of the product)
      - Active user base and user retention rate (to track the number of active users over
      time and measuring the rate at which users continue to engage with the product)
      - User feedback and satisfaction ratings (to gather feedback through surveys,
      reviews, or ratings to gauge user satisfaction and identify areas for improvement)

      
● Impact on Users: This metric focuses on assessing the actual impact of the product on the
lives of people with visual disabilities. Key metrics could be:
      - User testimonials and success stories (for collecting qualitative feedback and
      stories from users about how the product has improved their daily lives,
      independence, and inclusivity)
      - Surveys or interviews measuring improvements (for conducting surveys or
      interviews to gather quantitative data on the users' ability to navigate their
      surroundings, understand visual information and engage with the environment
      after using the product)
      - Quantitative data on assistive feature usage (for analyzing data on the usage of
      specific product features, such as audio description functionality, to understand
      the extent to which the product is meeting users' needs)

      
● Reach and Awareness: This metric evaluates the reach and visibility of the product,
indicating its market penetration and impact on the target audience. Key metrics could be:
      - Website traffic and social media metrics (for monitoring website visits, unique
      visitors, page views, as well as engagement metrics on social media platforms
      (followers, likes, comments, shares)
      - Media coverage and press mentions (for tracking the number of media outlets or
      publications that have covered the product, indicating its visibility in the public
      domain)
      - Attendance and participation in events (for assessing the level of engagement and
      participation in workshops, seminars, and awareness campaigns, indicating the
      effectiveness of outreach efforts)

Lastly, regular data analysis and ongoing evaluation will help guide strategic decision-making
and drive continuous improvement.
